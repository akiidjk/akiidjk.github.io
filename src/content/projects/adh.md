description: 'This project is nothing innovative or groundbreaking. I just wanted to create my own webhook to deploy on a VPS, avoiding dependencies on tools like webhook.site, localtunnel, ngrok, or other similar services. It is fully customizable, and you can use it for various purposes like logging, request handling, or data collection.'
